Most of them aren\u2019t what we want. We want to spend our time and focus solving problems for the business, but to do that well, we need to enact our own blueprint for software delivery. So far, enterprises piece together pipeline tools, configured by a plethora of YAML or by hand in a GUI. For anything interesting, we resort to a Bash script, the lowest common denominator of programming. We enroll myriad chatbots to spam our channels. We write how-to wiki pages and distribute hand-me-down scripts. As our practices improve, older projects languish in prior standards. Meanwhile we shake our heads wistfully over the elegant flow of shiny new delivery tools \u2013 they will never fit our real-world environment. Atomist says, there is a better way. A world beyond pipelines, a world of little YAML and Bash, a world where we code our way to an appropriate delivery experience, with higher coding standards, up-to-date application suites, and continual improvement. And this way begins where we are, not with a big migration. The new world is driven by events, not configuration, and we specify our reactions in a modern programming language. These events are correlated to each other into a coherent model, an API for Software. Developers and automations work together, coordinating in chat. Decisions are for people; consistent execution of tedious tasks is for programs. Escape Bash and YAML Tired of managing CI/CD Bash scripts and YAML config across dozens of repositories? Use Atomist to tame the complexity and execute your best delivery process across all your repositories. What is this better way? Atomist lets you construct your delivery process in code \u2013 but not too much code. A service, a framework, and some libraries take care of the pieces that are common to every development organization. Atomist works atop your existing toolchain, adding functionality and smoothing your experience; then you\u2019re free to improve it. The crux of your development experience lives in your software delivery machine (SDM). This is a service that runs wherever you choose to run it. Start with one of ours, then make it yours. Your SDM is in TypeScript (or JavaScript works too), and comes with a framework designed for software delivery and development automation. Write functions to make decisions or take action, with access to all the code plus the context of the push or build or issue event. All of this is open source. While you can run an SDM independently and in private to help only yourself, the magic happens when it connects to the Atomist service to respond to your whole team or organization. The service provides triggering with rich events and custom commands, interactive chat integration, and built-in automations like sweet chat messages for standard events like code push and issue creation. These chat messages get updated when new information comes in. They include useful buttons to take action: raise a PR, label an issue, or approve the next step in the deploy process. But wait, there\u2019s more! I\u2019ve talked about how your delivery flow can be defined in code instead of Bash, in one open place instead of many narrow pipelines. I mentioned custom commands, where you can ensconce common developer activities in a convenient location, accessible from chat. These commands are code: consistent, shared, versioned. You might have gleaned that because your Software Delivery Machine is code, you\u2019re never limited to plugins, nor to anyone else\u2019s idea of the correct delivery mechanism; your SDM can integrate with your existing tools. Keep the tools that are working for you , and integrate new ones as you wish. Tie these together with an SDM, plus bonuses like automatic CHANGELOG management . Your SDM gives you something else: the ability to manipulate code across all your projects with one command. Atomist libraries help you write code transforms\u2013functions that operate on code\u2013and the API for Software turns those into branches, pull requests, or automatic commits on every deviating push. Bring code up to standards and then keep it there. Your SDM gives you something else: start new projects with the right code and setup, every time. Atomist generators start from a real, working project and use code transforms to construct a starting point in a new repository. Your SDM can respond to more events , and to custom events that you send. You can query your correlated events using GraphQL. You can build chat commands, with updating messages and adding action buttons. You can add integrations and commands written by Atomist and the community, and contribute your own.

Use this to explore, whether or not you have access to the Atomist service, and whether or not your team has other SDMs running. The easiest way to get started with Atomist is to work on your laptop in local mode . You will create your own software delivery machine, use it, and then customize it, all in the privacy of your machine. Later, you can connect your SDM to the Atomist service, and then it will work with your team\u2019s version control and chat. An Atomist SDM can run any delivery process, and many other things besides\u2013but for exploration we have to start somewhere. Let\u2019s pretend your team operates several web services, you write them in Java using Spring Boot, and you like build them with maven. Since this SDM is for your personal use on your laptop, \u201cdeployment\u201d means starting the service up locally. We are going to create a new SDM project, build it, run it, and then use it: we will create a new Spring web service, make commits to it, and see it deployed. You\u2019ll need Git , Node.js (this comes with npm ), and the Java JDK installed. Run the listed commands in a terminal on Mac or Linux, or in Bash on Windows (git-bash, cygwin, or turn on bash support). Quick start Install the Atomist command-line utility. We will use this to create a new SDM project and to start it up. npm install -g @atomist/cli Create a local software delivery machine (SDM). This is going to create a new project in the Atomist projects directory (which defaults to $HOME/atomist/projects ). atomist create sdm Select the default machine, spring . When prompted for the name of the target repository, enter quick-sdm . When prompted for a target owner, enter your user name (on GitHub or anywhere). The output of this command includes the newly created file directory. In that directory, Change into the newly created SDM project. cd $HOME/atomist/<target owner>/quick-sdm Start your local SDM. atomist start --local The above command will install the project dependencies using NPM, compile the TypeScript, and start your SDM. Depending on your network connection, this may take a minute or more. Leave this terminal window open. Logs will print to this screen. In another terminal, check what your SDM can do. This will print a list of commands supported by your running quick-sdm. atomist show skills Start up the SDM feed so you can see what the SDM is doing. atomist feed Leave this terminal window open. Messages will print here. Now it is time to use your SDM. While it is running, the atomist command line utility can send your commands to it. In another terminal, create a Spring Boot project. atomist create spring This command will connect to your locally running SDM and use its capabilities to create a new Spring Boot project for you. When prompted for the target repository, enter quick-spring . When prompted for group identifier and root package, enter com.me and com.me.spring , respectively. (These are maven concepts.) When prompted for the target owner, enter your user name again. If you look in the terminal with the Atomist feed, you will see the SDM cloning the seed repository, cloning it locally, building it, and deploying it locally. The first time you run this, it may take a few minutes as it downloads all the Maven and project dependencies. You can go to the URL provided for the local deployment and verify that your new Spring Boot application is running. Move into your newly created Spring Boot project. cd ~/atomist/<your user name>/quick-spring Change the message in your Spring Boot application. Edit src/main/java/com/me/spring/QuickSpringController.java , changing \u201cworld\u201d to your location. Then commit your change. git add src/main/java/com/me/spring/QuickSpringController.java git commit -m 'Update location' Go back to the Atomist feed to observe your locally running SDM noticing your commit and respond by building and deploying your latest version.

That can be for your team or for you personally\u2013one of each is good. An Atomist Software Delivery Machine (SDM) provides a high-level interface for you to take action when things happen. In much the same way your continuous integration build kicks off when you push to your repository, Atomist can execute tasks like security scans, documentation publication, release creation, and deployment. Because you\u2019re using a real programming language, not YAML or Bash, and because you have access to a real ecosystem, Node.js, you can create the richest delivery experience you can imagine. API for Software An SDM links up to the API for software , exposing: What we know : The Atomist cortex, accessible through GraphQL queries and subscription joins What just happened : An event, triggered by a GraphQL subscription, which is contextualized with the existing knowledge What you\u2019re working on : A library that enables you to comprehend and manipulate the source code you\u2019re working on. When a push occurs, the SDM gets all this context and the code. It decides what delivery actions to take, and sets goals accordingly. Instead of a static pipeline, you get to choose the delivery flow for each commit. A push is not the only event that matters in our software development. The Atomist development automation platform ingests events from your software development systems: Source code repositories like GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Issue tracking systems like GitHub and Jira Continuous integration platforms like Travis CI , CircleCI , and Jenkins Application frameworks like Spring Runtime platforms like Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry Custom events from any other system you use and makes them available via the Atomist API for software. As Atomist ingests events, typically via webhook JSON payloads, it automatically correlates them to each other: commits to pushes to builds to deployments to running containers. This results in a data model that represents your development flow. The Software Delivery Machine subscribes to the most important events, like a push to source control and a completed build. You can subscribe to more events and take action when they occur, with the data model providing the necessary context so your automations can always do the right thing. The development automation platform also provides a simple yet powerful interface for implementing custom chat bot commands, also executable from your command line. Atomist provides all the infrastructure needed to recognize commands, collect parameters, execute the code, and respond. This lets you focus on writing your command code, not boilerplate code and ceremony around running bots. Instead of shell scripts that are useful only to you, write commands that help your whole team. Coding your SDM A software delivery machine uses the @atomist/sdm framework to specify the code delivery process and other automations. You don\u2019t configure your SDM: you code it, by combining or writing functions in TypeScript (or JavaScript). Some common setups, such as deliverying and maintaining Spring Boot apps or npm libraries, are provided in extension packs . You can configure the whole pack, or use functions from the pack in your own setup. Connect your SDM Atomist maintains two implementations of the API for Software: Team mode: a complete, cloud-based service, Local mode: an open-source, filesystem-based version that runs on your laptop. An SDM is most useful when running for your whole team, connected to the Atomist API for software, Slack, and your version control. Run it on your laptop while you\u2019re testing and modifying the SDM, then in your favorite production environment (on-prem or in the cloud) for ongoing use. If you don\u2019t want to subscribe to the Atomist service and hook up Slack and GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab etc, you\u2019re in luck! Run your SDM in local mode, on your own machine. Receive push events from your own local commits, get messages in a terminal feed, and run trigger commands on the command line. An SDM can also run locally, on your laptop. From there, either connect to the Atomist API for software (team mode), or run in local mode: respond to git commits, see messages in a terminal running atomist feed , and send commands to Atomist from the command line. The SDM is a persistent process that runs in the background, whether in local or team mode. While the SDM is most valuable when it is coordinating delivery and performing commands for your whole team, you can also test and operate an SDM in local mode, on your laptop, without connecting to the Atomist API.

An Autofix checks every push, and if the code doesn\u2019t look like you want it to, changes it and makes a commit. The instructions in this page apply after: You have an SDM that [sets goals][goals] You have a code transform command . This page shows how to: Turn a code transform into an autofix Skip some pushes goals Change a code transform into an autofix Assume that we have the following code transform: export const AddApacheLicenseFileTransform : CodeTransform < NoParameters > = async ( p : Project ) => { const httpClient = DefaultHttpClientFactory . create (); const license = await httpClient . exchange ( \"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt\" ); return p . addFile ( \"LICENSE\" , license . body as string ); }; We can create an AutofixRegistration . export const AddApacheLicenseFileAutofix : AutofixRegistration = { name : \"add apache license file\" , transform : AddApacheLicenseFileTransform , pushTest : not ( hasFile ( \"LICENSE\" )), options : { ignoreFailure : false , considerOnlyChangedFiles : false , }, }; An AutofixRegistration references the code transform (or an array of code transforms). Each autofix will make its own commit, and the name appears in the commit message: Autofix: <name of the autofix> See also: AutofixRegistration API Docs Skip some pushes The optional PushTest field limits when the Autofix will be applied. If the test returns false, Atomist will skip this Autofix. Here, we only want to add a license file to pushes that do not currently have one. We have the following PushTest that checks whether a project contains a license file. hasFile ( \"LICENSE\" ) hasFile returns true if a file is present in the code. The not function inverts the result, so the Autofix will only run when there is no LICENSE file present in the project after a push. For more push tests, see Push Tests . Autofix Registration options You can define a set of options on the registration: ignoreFailure : failures in the transform will cause other later autofixes to not be applied if set to false considerOnlyChangedFiles : the code transform will only be applied to files that have been changed in the push if set to true Add the autofix goal to your goalset If you already have an Autofix goal, register your new autofix on it: autofixGoal . with ( AddApacheLicenseFileAutofix ); If not, get one. First you instantiate the goal itself and add the AutofixRegistration to it. const autofixGoal = new Autofix (). with ( AddApacheLicenseFileAutofix ); Then you add the goal to your goal set.

As a full-featured CI solution, Atomist provides the functionality needed to perform builds. Or, integrate with your existing build tools. With Atomist, you can start where you are and then have the flexibility to move where you want to go. This page shows how to Run builds in your SDM Set a goal to represent builds that happen in your CI tool The Build goal Atomist provides a goal that is designed to handle building software: the Build goal. It lives in the Build Pack , so run npm install @atomist/sdm-pack-build to get it. The build goal does a couple things: Invoke a builder that builds your project Link the built artifact Configuring the BuildGoal looks like this const build = new Build (). with ({ name : \"maven\" , builder : mavenBuilder (), }); This goal defines a build that will be handled by Maven. Be sure to add the goal to your goal set . Builders Builders implement the logic that is needed to build your software. Out of the box, Atomist provides a couple of builders for: Maven Gradle NodeJS using NPM Generic builder that calls a terminal script You can also create your own. A builder is a function that gets a GoalInvocation and a build number and return a Promise<BuildInProgress> ( goalInvocation : GoalInvocation , buildNo : string ) => Promise < BuildInProgress > Builds handled by external systems In addition to handling the CI lifecycle itself, Atomist can also defer the build to external systems like your existing CI lifecycle. To achieve this, you need to define your build goal like this: const build = new Build (). with ({ name : \"maven\" , externalTool : \"travis\" }); You can find more detailed information on how to hook up existing CI systems on the integrations page . Atomist builders Maven Maven builds are supported out of the box through the mavenBuilder found in sdm-pack-spring . The builder is defined as such export function mavenBuilder ( args : Array < { name : string , value? : string } > = [], deploymentUnitFileLocator : ( p : LocalProject , mpi : VersionedArtifact ) => string = ( p , mpi ) => ` ${ p . baseDir } /target/ ${ mpi . artifact } - ${ mpi . version } .jar` ) : Builder The Maven builder will issue a mvn package (or use mvnw if that\u2019s available in the project) command to build your project. The first argument of the builder allows you to add extra -D arguments to the Maven build command, if a value is defined it will add -Dname=value , otherwise it will add -Dname . The second argument will indicate where the build goal can find the artifact produced by the build. This is the artifact that for example can be used in other goals like deployment. By default, it will look in the default location as defined by Maven conventions, i.e. target/artifact-version.jar , but you can change this if you like. Aside from an in-process Maven build, Atomist also provides a dockerized Maven builder, which is defined as such export function dockerizedMavenBuilder ( version : string = DefaultMavenDockerVersion , args : Array < { name : string , value? : string } > = [], deploymentUnitFileLocator : ( p : LocalProject , mpi : VersionedArtifact ) => string = ( p , mpi ) => ` ${ p . baseDir } /target/ ${ mpi . artifact } - ${ mpi . version } .jar` ) : Builder In addition to the same options as the in-process Maven builder, the dockerized version also allows you to define a version. Upon goal execution, this builder will use a docker run command to invoke Maven. In other words, you don\u2019t need to have a Maven installation on the SDM or have your project configured to use the Maven wrapper. Danger If you\u2019re running your SDM in Docker, please take care to take into account the Docker-in-Docker or the Docker-outside-of-Docker guidelines if you use the dockerized Maven builder Gradle Atomist also provide support for building projects using Gradle. At the moment, only single module projects are supported. To use the Gradle integration, configure your Build goal like this using the gradleSingleModuleBuilder in sdm-pack-spring : const build = new Build (). with ({ name : \"maven\" , builder : gradleSingleModuleBuilder (), }); The Maven builder will issue a gradle clean build (or use gradlew if that\u2019s available in the project) command to build your project. NPM If you want to build NodeJS projects using NPM, Atomist can certainly help you with that. In order to do so, define your Build goal like this, using the nodeBuilder available in @atomist/sdm-pack-node : const build = new Build (). with ({ name : \"maven\" , builder : nodeBuilder ( \"run\" , \"build\" ), }); In this case the builder will execute an npm run build command in the root of your project.

Linking the artifact produced by the build In order to capture the output deliverable of a build you can use the Artifact goal. When added to a goalset, it will be fulfilled by the Build goal after successful completion of a build that is able to store the artifact in a more permanent store.

This can be any action that you write in a TypeScript function. What would you like your team to do more frequently or more consistently? This page will show you how to: create a command test your command respond to the person who invoked the command wrap a shell script in a command define parameters for your command This page starts after you have created an SDM. Create a command First, we\u2019ll write the function for our command. For this example, we will write the classic \u201chello, world\u201d function. To be able to respond regardless of whether the command was invoked on the command line, in chat, or the web interface, we need to learn a little about what a command function looks like. We call these command functions \u201clisteners\u201d, because they are always listening for someone to call them. All command listeners take a single argument, a CommandListenerInvocation , which provides some useful information to the command, like how to respond to the person who invoked the command. Command listeners are asynchronous functions, returning a Promise . The value of the Promise should be an object with at least a code property, whose value is a number . If the value is 0 (zero), the command execution is considered successful. If it is non-zero, the command execution is considered unsuccessful. Armed with this information, we can write our command listener function. import { HandlerResult , NoParameters } from \"@atomist/automation-client\" ; import { CommandListenerInvocation } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; export async function helloWorldListener ( ci : CommandListenerInvocation < NoParameters > ) : Promise < HandlerResult > { await ci . context . messageClient . respond ( \"Hello, world\" ); return { code : 0 }; } You can see the CommandListenerInvocation has a context property that provides a messageClient property that allows you to respond , which is an asynchronous function so we await it. Test your command Testing your command listener requires that you mock the parts of CommandListenerInvocation you use and then call your function. Using the Mocha testing framework, it would look something like this. import { NoParameters } from \"@atomist/automation-client\" ; import { CommandListenerInvocation } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; import * as assert from \"assert\" ; describe ( \"helloWorldListener\" , () => { it ( \"should respond successfully\" , async () => { let response : string ; const ci : CommandListenerInvocation < NoParameters > = { context : { messageClient : { respond : async ( m : string ) => response = m , }, }, }; const result = await helloWorldListener ( ci ); assert ( result ); assert ( result . code === 0 ); assert ( response === \"Hello, world\" ); }); }); We assign the message sent to the respond method so we can later confirm it was the message we expected. Register your command The next thing to do is register your command in your SDM. First, we create a CommandHandlerRegistration . import { CommandHandlerRegistration } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const helloWorldCommand : CommandHandlerRegistration = { name : \"HelloWorld\" , description : \"Responds with a friendly greeting to everyone\" , intent : \"hello\" , listener : async ci => { await ci . context . messageClient . respond ( \"Hello, world\" ); return { code : 0 }; }, }; We provide a unique name and description in the registration. The value of the intent property defines the command you enter to invoke the command listener function. Here we have defined our function inline. In the test, we would also have to update the invocation of the command to helloWorldCommand.listener(ci) . Once we have the registration, we can add the command to our SDM object. import { Configuration } from \"@atomist/automation-client\" ; import { SoftwareDeliveryMachine , SoftwareDeliveryMachineConfiguration , } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; import { createSoftwareDeliveryMachine , configureSdm , } from \"@atomist/sdm-core\" ; function machine ( configuration : SoftwareDeliveryMachineConfiguration ) : SoftwareDeliveryMachine { const sdm = createSoftwareDeliveryMachine ({ name : \"My SDM\" , configuration , }); sdm . addCommand ( helloWorldCommand ); return sdm ; } export const configuration : Configuration = { postProcessors : [ configureSdm ( machine )], }; The configuration object should be exported from the index.ts of your SDM. Run your command If you are running your SDM in local mode, start the SDM as you normally would atomist start --local and then in another terminal run the hello command: atomist hello and the SDM should respond in the same terminal. In team mode, once you have started your SDM you can send the intent to the Atomist bot @atomist hello and it will respond back to you in the channel. Wrap a shell script If you want to turn a shell script into a bot command, just call that shell script from a command listener. You can use the safeExec helper to capture the output and respond back with it. import { safeExec } from \"@atomist/automation-client\" ; import { CommandHandlerRegistration } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const myScriptCommand : CommandHandlerRegistration = { name : \"MyScript\" , description : \"Run my-script and respond with its stdout\" , intent : \"my script\" , listener : async ci => { const result = await safeExec ( \"my-script\" , [ \"its\" , \"args\" ]); await ci . context . messageClient . respond ( result . stdout ); return { code : 0 }; }, }; Command parameters Section content not yet populated Sorry, we haven\u2019t written this part of the documentation yet.

Fingerprints are data computed against a push. Think of them as snapshots. Typically they reflect the state of the repository\u2019s source code after the push; they can also take into account other characteristics of the commit. Fingerprinting is valuable because: It enables us to assess the impact of a particular commit, through providing a semantic diff . For example, did the commit change dependencies? Did it change some particularly sensitive files that necessitate closer than usual review? It enables us to understand the evolution of a code base over time. Atomist persists fingerprints, so we can trace over time anything we fingerprint, and report against it. For example, what is happening to code quality metrics over time? Atomist extension packs include some out of the box fingerprints, such as Maven and npm dependency fingerprints. This page describes how to: Create a custom fingerprint Look at your fingerprints in GraphQL Report on a fingerprint React to changes in a fingerprint Create a fingerprint But it\u2019s easy to write your own. Fingerprint registrations are like other listener registrations, specifying a name and PushTest . The following example is the complete code for fingerprinting dependencies specified in a package-lock.json file: export class PackageLockFingerprinter implements FingerprinterRegistration { public readonly name = \"PackageLockFingerprinter\" ; // optional; defaults to running on any push public readonly pushTest : PushTest = IsNode ; public async action ( cri : PushImpactListenerInvocation ) : Promise < FingerprinterResult > { const lockFile = await cri . project . getFile ( \"package-lock.json\" ); if ( ! lockFile ) { return []; } try { const content = await lockFile . getContent (); const json = JSON . parse ( content ); const deps = json . dependencies ; const dstr = JSON . stringify ( deps ); return { name : \"dependencies\" , abbreviation : \"deps\" , version : \"0.1\" , sha : computeShaOf ( dstr ), data : json , }; } catch ( err ) { logger . warn ( \"Unable to compute package-lock.json fingerprint: %s\" , err . message ); return []; } } } Fingerprinters can be added to an SDM as follows: fingerprint . with ( new PackageLockFingerprinter ()); Fingerprinting will only occur if fingerprint is a Fingerprint goal and it is included when goals are set . When the fingerprint goal executes, it will send the fingerprint to Atomist, where it will be attached to the commit in the graph, available to the API for Software. Query a fingerprint Verify that your fingerprint worked by finding it in GraphQL. In the Atomist dashboard (at https://app.atomist.com ), once you are logged in, click on the GraphQL icon. Here\u2019s a query: query Fingerprint { Commit(sha: \"efbf90778 your sha goes here f1b1e7bc6\") { fingerprints { name sha } } } After the SDM is running with the new fingerprint registered, and a push is made, then substitute the 40-character git SHA of the last pushed commit for the string in the above query. If it worked, the response should include something like this: \"data\" : { \"Commit\" : [ { \"fingerprints\" : [ { \"name\" : \"YourFingerprintName\" , \"sha\" : \"efbf90778cb6403ccef71ee5e89ef13f1b1e7bc6\" } ] } ] } , Here, the sha field contains whatever you put in the sha field of your fingerprint result.

An SDM allows you to process a push in any way you choose, but typically you want it to initiate a delivery flow. An SDM allows you to set goals on push. Goals correspond to the actions that make up a delivery flow, such as build and deployment. The goals set on a push are not the same every time. The delivery flow is not the same for every change! Goals aren\u2019t configured per repository. They are chosen dynamically, in response to any push in any repository, based on the code and the context. What kind of project is it? What branch was pushed? Is there a pull request? Which files changed? Goals are not necessarily sequential\u2013by default they execute in parallel\u2013but certain goals, such as deployment, have preconditions (goals that must have previously completed successfully). In Slack, a push notification with several goals looks like this: This page shows how to create goals teach them what to do require approval The next page describes how to set goals for each push . Create goals Set up goals wherever you configure your SDM, probably in lib/machine/machine.ts . This example comes from an SDM for Java Spring Boot web services . A Goal object supplies its name, descriptions for its various possible states, and an implementation. There are several built-in goal implementations, or you can create your own . For instance, an Autofix goal has one autofix registered on it; it will add license headers to any code file that doesn\u2019t have one yet, and make a commit. const autofix = new Autofix (). with ( AddLicenseFile ); After you\u2019ve created some goals, choose when to set them . Built-in Goals A goal object has some identifying information, code to fulfill the goal, and sometimes preconditions (goals that need to complete before this one can go). Some common ones have their own constructors: AutoInspect Run an inspection on the code; if the code doesn\u2019t pass, you can fail the goals or require approval (a button push). To use it, you\u2019ll need to create one, set it on each push, and register inspections on it. Instantiate an empty one: export const codeInspection = new AutoCodeInspection (); And set it when you want it to run on a push. Here\u2019s the shortest way to run this goal on every push: sdm . addGoalContributions ( goalContributors ( onAnyPush (). setGoals ( goals ( \"Inspections\" ). plan ( codeInspection )))) Now the fun part: register inspections on it. Check the Inspections page for more on how to write inspections. Once you have an AutoInspectRegistration , register it on your goal: codeInspection . with ( MyAutoInspectRegistration ) . with ( AnotherInspectRegistration ); You can register any number of inspections. You can call with on the goal at any point in SDM configuration. If no inspections are registered, the goal will succeed. If any registration\u2019s onInspectionResult returns \u201cfail\u201d, the goal will fail. If none return \u201cfail\u201d but one returns \u201crequire approval\u201d, the goal will go to Waiting for Approval state until someone clicks the Approve button in Slack or on the Atomist dashboard. Autofix Section content not yet populated Sorry, we haven\u2019t written this part of the documentation yet. Will you tell us what questions are important to you? We\u2019re happy to help in the #support channel in Atomist community Slack . You can also contribute to this guide with an issue or pull request on the docs repository . PushImpact This allows you to react to the code, with information about the changes in the given push.

Besides being a great query language, GraphQL provides great tool support based on strongly-typed schemas, type generation for TypeScript, and many other advantages. The Atomist SDM includes many of the GraphQL queries that are most useful in automating software delivery. You can also create your own. The following sections tell you how to use GraphQL to query your data, how to use subscriptions to get notifications when new data is ingested, and how to mutate data. Accessing data with Graph i QL For development purposes it is often helpful to test GraphQL queries using a user interface. The Atomist web application provides the Graph i QL GraphQL client, which allows you write and run queries, displaying the shape of the resulting data. Graph i QL also provides access to the data model documentation. Queries You can execute queries from command and event handlers when running an Atomist API client using the GraphClient.query() function. A GraphClient is available from the HandlerContext included in listener invocations via its graphClient property. The query() function takes a single argument: a QueryOptions object. The actual GraphQL query can be supplied as a string via the query property of QueryOptions , as the path to a file containing the query via the path property, or as the name of a query in the project\u2019s GraphQL query files via the name property. The path property can be an absolute or relative path, the latter being resolved against the path of the calling script. The name should be the name of a GraphQL query operation found within a file with a .graphql extension in a graphql/query folder in the directory of the calling script or one of its parents. Note Externalizing queries in files makes it possible to generate types for use in your TypeScript code. More on that later. The following example shows you how to query for pushes and see all corresponding continuous integration builds. Start by creating the query. The sample query includes a variable and a predicate that matches only failed builds. This example assumes the query is saved in a file called pushesWithFailedBuilds.graphql . query PushesWithFailedBuilds ($name: String!) { Push { repo(name: $name) { name owner } builds(status: failed) { name status buildUrl } } } Once the query is defined, you can use it with the GraphClient to execute a query. const result = await invocation . context . graphClient . query ({ name : \"PushesWithFailedBuilds\" , variables : { name : \"demo-service\" }, }) } The query method takes the name of the query as the name property of its first parameter. The name provided matches that in the GraphQL file. The variables property in the above example is used to provide the value for the query variable. Custom Event Handlers TODO: document Subscriptions As detailed in the section on event handlers, GraphQL subscriptions can be used to subscribe to events as they get ingested into the Atomist platform. Subscriptions can\u2019t be executed with the GraphClient ; instead they can only be used from an event handler. Many of these are included in the SDM. There are two ways to declare subscriptions on event handlers: either by embedded strings or by referencing external files, which is more reusable. This example demonstrates subscribing using an external file: subscription PushesWithFailedBuilds { Push { repo { name owner } builds(status: failed) { name status buildUrl } } } A GraphQL subscription begins with the keyword subscription followed by a name for the subscription, PushesWithFailedBuilds in this case. After the opening brace, you specify the type of the top-level event you are subscribing to, Push in this example. Your subscription then defines the structured data you want to receive for each such event, navigating the data model\u2019s properties and relationships to connect related data elements like pushes, repositories, and CI builds. Note When specifying the filename, the .graphql extension is optional. Mutations Most of the data in the Atomist platform is ingested via Webhooks and is read-only. There are however a small number of very useful GraphQL mutations available. Mutation Description createSlackChannel Create a new public channel in Slack addBotToSlackChannel Invite the Atomist bot user into the given channel inviteUserToSlackChannel Invite any user into the given channel linkSlackChannelToRepo Link a GitHub repository to a Slack channel setTeamPreference Set preference data on the team entity setUserPreference Set preference data on the user entity Like queries, mutations can be loaded from files and executed with the GraphClient . Here is an example showing how to create a new channel in Slack. Here\u2019s the GraphQL file containing the mutation: mutation CreateSlackChannel($name: String!) { createSlackChannel(name: $name) { id } } This invokes the mutation from the GraphQL file: await invocation . context . graphClient . mutate ({ name : \"CreateSlackChannel\" , variables : { name : \"random\" }, }) Strongly-typed GraphQL queries One nice side-effect of using GraphQL as the query layer is that you can generate types for use with TypeScript from the schema and your queries, subscriptions, and mutations. To generate types for your externalized GraphQL operations, run npm run gql:gen . This creates a file called types.ts in src/typings/ . Now you can change the earlier query to use those types: import * as graphql from \"./typings/types\" ; //... const result = await invocation . context . graphClient . query < graphql .

We\u2019re happy to help in the #support channel in Atomist community Slack . You can also contribute to this guide with an issue or pull request on the docs repository . Custom inspections An inspection looks at a repository and produces some report. It is implemented as a function from Project to an inspection result, plus a separate function to react to these results. You decide what an inspection result contains, how to populate it, and how to react to them. Create your inspection and a command to run it on demand in any project or projects. Then you can add it as an automatic inspection to every commit, if you like. Declare a result type Start by deciding what your inspection wants to say about a repository. For instance, your inspection might look for files with too many lines. Your result might contain the paths of files that have too many lines in them. Here, the type is defined as a string array. type FilesWithTooManyLines = string []; Create an inspection function The CodeInspection is a function from a project (and optionally, inspection parameters) to an inspection result. The Project is an Atomist abstraction over a repository directory and the files inside it. Your inspection can call functions on the Project to determine the result. For instance, this one gathers all the file paths where the content is over 1000 lines: import { NoParameters , Project , projectUtils , } from \"@atomist/autiomation-client\" ; const InspectFileLengths : CodeInspection < FilesWithTooManyLines , NoParameters > = async ( p : Project ) => { // this sample code returns the paths to TypeScript files with over 1000 lines const longFiles = await projectUtils . gatherFromFiles ( p , \"**/*.ts\" , async f => { const c = await f . getContent (); const lineCount = c . split ( \"\\n\" ). length ; if ( lineCount > 1000 ) { return f . path ; } else { return undefined ; } }); return longFiles . filter ( path => path !== undefined ); }; Create a function to react to this result Usually when you run a code inspection, you want to report back to yourself or your team what the results were. Since your inspection returns a custom type, you have to define what to do with it. We need a function that reacts to the inspection results. It takes an input an array of CodeInspectionResult which includes information about the repository that was inspected and the results of the inspection. For instance, the following reaction function sends a message containing the identifying information of the project and a summary of the results: import { CodeInspectionResult , CommandListenerInvocation , } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; async function sendFilesWithTooManyLinesMessage ( results : Array < CodeInspectionResult < FilesWithTooManyLines >> , inv : CommandListenerInvocation ) { const message = results . map ( r => ` ${ r . repoId . owner } / ${ r . repoId . repo } There are ${ r . result . length } files with too many lines` ) . join ( \"\\n\" ); return inv . addressChannels ( message ); } Create a command to run the inspection and react to it Combine the inspection and the reaction into an object, a command registration. The intent is what you\u2019ll type to get Atomist to run the inspection. import { NoParameters } from \"@atomist/autiomation-client\" ; import { CodeInspectionRegistration } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const InspectFileLengthsCommand : CodeInspectionRegistration < FilesWithTooManyLines , NoParameters > = { name : \"InspectFileLengths\" , description : \"Files should be under 1000 lines\" , intent : \"inspect file lengths\" , inspection : InspectFileLengths , onInspectionResults : sendFilesWithTooManyLinesMessage , }; Register the command on your SDM Finally, teach the SDM about your command. In machine.ts , or wherever you configure your SDM, add sdm . addCodeInspectionCommand ( InspectFileLengthsCommand ); Run the inspection Recompile and restart your SDM. Depending on the context where you run @atomist inspect file lengths , you\u2019ll receive a response for one or many projects. For local mode: run it within a repository directory to inspect one project, or one directory up (within an owner directory) to inspect all repositories under that owner, or anywhere else to inspect all repositories. For team mode, in Slack: address Atomist in a channel linked to a repository to inspect that repository: @atomist inspect file lengths . Or, specify a regular expression of repository names to check them all: @atomist inspect file lengths targets.repos=\".*\" . Automatically run your code inspection You may use your inspection to find places in the code that need to change, and then change them. But how will you know when the file lengths creep back up? Make an auto code inspection run on every push (or in local mode, on every commit). Then you can point out when a file has reached 1000 lines. You can point this out with a message, by creating an issue, by failing the goal, or by asking people to push a button to approve the unorthodox file length. Make your inspection return a review Rather than returning the arbitrary type FilesWithTooManyLines , we first convert our inspection to return a ProjectReview , which packages information about the project being inspected with the comments from the inspection. import { NoParameters , Project , ProjectReview , projectUtils , ReviewComment , } from \"@atomist/autiomation-client\" ; const InspectFileLengths : CodeInspection < ProjectReview , NoParameters > = async ( p : Project ) => { const longFiles = await projectUtils . gatherFromFiles ( p , \"**/*.ts\" , async f => { const c = await f . getContent (); const lineCount = c . split ( \"\\n\" ). length ; if ( lineCount > 1000 ) { return f . path ; } else { return undefined ; } }). filter ( path => path !== undefined ); const comments : ReviewComment [] = longFiles . map ( f => ({ severity : \"warn\" , detail : \"File has more than 1000 lines\" , category : \"file\" , subcategory : \"file-length\" , sourceLocation : { path : f }, })); return { repoId : p.id , comments }; }; Decide what should happen What qualifies as a failed inspection and what should happen when an inspection fails? Decide this in a function that listens for your code inspection results and returns a PushImpactResponse : proceed , failGoals , or requireApprovalToProceed . You also get access to an invocation object, in case you want to post a message as well. Let\u2019s use that to send the message from this function and no longer use the now out-of-date sendFilesWithTooManyLinesMessage function. import { ReviewListener } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const failGoalsIfCommentsReviewListener : ReviewListener = async rli => { if ( rli . review . comments && rli . review . comments . length > 0 ) { await rli . addressChannels ( \"The following files have more than 1000 lines:\\n\" + rli . review . comments . map ( c => c . sourceLocation . path ). join ( \"\\n\" )); return PushImpactResponse . failGoals ; } return PushImpactResponse . proceed ; }; Update the registrations Update the registration to reflect the new return type, ProjectReview , and remove the onInspectionResults property. import { NoParameters , ProjectReview , } from \"@atomist/automation-client\" ; import { CodeInspectionRegistration } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const InspectFileLengthsCommand : CodeInspectionRegistration < ProjectReview , NoParameters > = { name : \"InspectFileLengths\" , description : \"Files should be under 1000 lines\" , intent : \"inspect file lengths\" , inspection : InspectFileLengths , }; Also create a registration for the review listener: import { ReviewListenerRegistration } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const FailGoalsIfComments : ReviewListenerRegistration = { name : \"Fail Goals if any code inspections result in comments\" , listener : failGoalsIfCommentsReviewListener , }; AutoInspect goal Finally, attach this code inspection and its listener to your AutoCodeInspection goal: import { AutoCodeInspection } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const codeInspection = new AutoCodeInspection (); codeInspection . with ( AutoInspectFileLengths ) . withListener ( FailGoalsIfComments ); Activate your AutoCodeInspection by setting the goal when a push happens.

See the Developer Quick Start to get started. This document describes the prerequisites for running an SDM for your whole team , connecting to your source control manager, chat system, and continuous integration tools. Before you begin developing and running your own software deliver machine (SDM), you need an Atomist account and several other prerequisites. Atomist workspace As part of creating an account with Atomist, you created an Atomist workspace. To run SDMs, you will need the ID of your Atomist workspace. You can find your Atomist workspace ID on your workspace\u2019s settings page in the Atomist web application . Node.js The reference implementation of the Atomist SDM is implemented in TypeScript , a superset of JavaScript . To develop and run it, you must install Node.js. The easiest way to install Node.js is to go to the Node.js web site and follow the installation instructions for your platform. This makes the node and npm programs available on your system. Alternatively, macOS users with Homebrew can install Node.js with the following command: brew install node Once you have node and npm available, it is a good idea to update to the latest version of NPM using the following command. npm install -g npm Git Atomist supports software development using Git and uses the Git command-line tool to perform many of its actions. You must have the Git CLI installed for Atomist tools to function properly. Atomist CLI The Atomist CLI performs several useful functions that are referred to throughout this documentation. Once you have Node.js installed, install the Atomist CLI with the following command: npm install -g @atomist/cli Installation on GNU/Linux On GNU/Linux systems, including when running in a Docker environment, you may need to add the --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root command-line options to the above command to avoid permission errors and successfully install. Atomist API key To start your own SDM, you will need an Atomist API key so the client can properly register with the API. You can generate an Atomist API key on the API key page of the Atomist web application . You will need an Atomist API key in the next section when running configure. Configure There are a few ways you can configure Atomist SDMs. While any of the approaches below will work in any scenario, some approaches are better for some use cases than others. If you are developing an SDM and running it locally on your workstation or laptop, user configuration is likely your best choice. If you are running an SDM on a server in a testing or production environment, you will likely want to use the environment variable approach. Regardless of the approach you take, the minimum information required to successfully start an SDM is an API key and a workspace ID . Depending on the SDM or other client you are trying to run, you may need to provide more configuration values. User configuration If you have a user configuration file on your system, it will be read and merged with any client-specific configuration whenever you start an SDM. In other words, it serves as a base configuration for all SDMs you run on your system. Run the following command to create and persist a user configuration on your local system. atomist config The above command will prompt you for your Atomist API key and workspace ID. The user configuration is a JSON-formatted object saved in the file $HOME/.atomist/client.config.json on Unix-like operating systems including macOS and %USERPROFILE%\\.atomist\\client.config.json on MS Windows operating systems. After running the above command, the contents of the user configuration file will look something like: { \"apiKey\" : \"API_KEY\" , \"workspaceIds\" : [ \"WORKSPACE_ID\" ] } with API_KEY and WORKSPACE_ID replaced with your Atomist API key and workspace ID, respectively. If you are in multiple Atomist workspaces and want to run your SDMs in all of them, simply add all of their workspace IDs to the workspaceIds array in the user configuration file. Environment variable When running an SDM on a server, especially when running in a containerized environment, it is typically better to provide the necessary configuration using environment variables. When an SDM starts up, it will attempt to parse a JSON-formatted configuration object from the ATOMIST_CONFIG environment variable and from the file provided by the ATOMIST_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. For example, to use the ATOMIST_CONFIG environment variable to provide the same configuration as that shown above in the user configuration section, you could run the following commands to set the environment variable and start the client. export ATOMIST_CONFIG='{\"apiKey\":\"API_KEY\",\"workspaceIds\":[\"WORKSPACE_ID\"]}' atomist start Similarly, if you created a file with the same contents as that show above in the user configuration section at /opt/sdm/sdm-config.json , then you tell the SDM to load that file by setting the following environment variable prior to starting the SDM. export ATOMIST_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/sdm/sdm-config.json atomist start If both environment variables are defined, their configuration values are merged with values in the ATOMIST_CONFIG environment variable taking precedence over those defined in the ATOMIST_CONFIG_PATH file.

An SDM automates all steps in the flow from project creation to production, and many other actions, using the consistent model provided by the Atomist API for software . Core Concepts An SDM builds on other Atomist core functionality available from global automations, such as Atomist lifecycle messages showing commit, pull request, and other activity through actionable messages in your chat client. GraphQL The Atomist automation API provides you access to the events and data from your development platforms using GraphQL , a widely-used query language and runtime for APIs. You can use GraphQL with the Atomist automation API for: Queries that fetch data directly Subscriptions to register the types of events you want to receive Mutations to change data and make connections WebSockets An Atomist SDM must maintain contact with the API server so that it can receive the events and commands it\u2019s interested in as they occur. SDMs access the Atomist automation API via a WebSocket connection. WebSockets allow the API server to send events and commands to the SDM without constant polling via HTTP calls. The WebSocket connection is initiated by the SDM when it starts up, establishing a persistent two-way communication channel between the SDM and API that is resilient to interruptions in connectivity. Events The heart of Atomist is its event handling. As your code flows from commit through to deployment and beyond, Atomist receives events, correlates the incoming data with its previous knowledge, and invokes your event handlers with rich context. This enables your automations to perform tasks such as: Scanning code for security or quality issues on every push Driving deployments and promotion between environments Performing custom actions on deployment, such as kicking off integration test suites. The Atomist correlated event model also enables Atomist to provide you with visibility throughout the commit to deployment flow, in Slack or through the Atomist web dashboard. See Events for more information. Event handlers subscribe to events using GraphQL subscriptions against the Atomist cortex. The following GraphQL subscribes to completed builds, returning related data such as the last commit and any linked Slack channels: subscription OnBuildComplete { Build { buildId buildUrl compareUrl name status commit { sha message repo { name owner gitHubId allowRebaseMerge channels { name id } } statuses { context description state targetUrl } } } } When using TypeScript (our recommended language), an event handler can subscribe to such events with the benefit of strong typing. For example, this Atomist event handler can respond to the above GraphQL subscription: @EventHandler ( \"Set status on build complete\" , GraphQL . subscriptionFromFile ( \"graphql/subscription/OnBuildComplete.graphql\" )) export class SetStatusOnBuildComplete implements HandleEvent < OnBuildComplete . Subscription > { public async handle ( event : EventFired < OnBuildComplete . Subscription > , ctx : HandlerContext , params : this ) : Promise < HandlerResult > { This underlying GraphQL/event handler infrastructure is generic and powerful. However, many things are better done at a higher level. This project provides a framework above this infrastructure that makes typical tasks far easier, while not preventing you from breaking out into lower level functionality. SDM process lifecycle The SDM lifecycle will be familiar to those developing persistent applications. Authentication - When the SDM starts up, it connects to the Atomist API and authenticates using the API key you have provided in your configuration file. Registration - Once your identity has been established, the client registers its automations, i.e., the bot commands it provides and the events it wants to receive, with the Atomist workspaces specified in your configuration. If Atomist does not recognize your workspace ID or the provided API key is not connected to any member of that workspace, registration will fail and the SDM will exit with an unsuccessful status. Listening - After authentication and registration is completed successfully, the WebSocket connection is established and the client begins listening for incoming messages from the API: bot commands and events fired. Shutdown - When the client receives a shutdown signal, typically SIGINT delivered by the PaaS or Ctrl-C , it de-registers with the API and gracefully shuts down. SDM state An SDM, once registered, will continue to receive all the events it has subscribed to until shuts down or one of the following scenarios occurs. Multiple identical SDMs register If another client with the same name and version (typically obtained from the package.json \u201cname\u201d and \u201cversion\u201d properties) registers, then all of the registered identical SDMs will receive the events in a round-robin fashion. Each event will only be sent to one of the identical SDMs. This allows you to horizontally scale. A different version registers If another SDM having the same name but different version registers, it will begin receiving all of the events for the client and any previously registered versions cease receiving events. Note that no version comparisons are done: the last registration wins . If the new client has registered with a policy of \u201cephemeral\u201d and the prior client was registered with a policy of \u201cdurable\u201d, then when the new client shuts down, events again be sent to the \u201cdurable\u201d registration clients. The reason for this logic is to allow for production, testing, and local use to all coexist without taking the same action multiple times. For example, if you are running an SDM in production but want to test something, you can run it locally, steal events for a bit, kill the local process, and then traffic will return to the production instance. If you want the same events to be sent to multiple SDMs, just make sure the SDMs have different names. Custom Ingestion Any custom ingestion types can only be registered once within an Atomist workspace. Therefore it is recommended to register these in a dedicated API client. SDM Framework concepts Push Mappings Let\u2019s now return to push mappings and goal setting. The PushMapping interface is used to decide how to handle pushes. Normally it is used via the DSL we\u2019ve seen. export interface PushMapping < V > { /** * Name of the PushMapping.

A GoalSetter is a PushMapping that returns Goals . A PushTest is simply a PushMapping that returns boolean . Code Examples Let\u2019s look at some examples. Issue Creation When a new issue is created, you may want to notify people or perform an action. Listener interfaces NewIssueListener : NewIssueListener Examples The following example notifies any user who raises an issue with insufficient detail in the body, via a direct message in Slack, and provides them with a helpful link to the issue. Note that we make use of the person available via the openedBy field: export async function requestDescription ( inv : NewIssueInvocation ) { if ( ! inv . issue . body || inv . issue . body . length < 10 ) { await inv . context . messageClient . addressUsers ( `Please add a description for new issue ${ inv . issue . number } : _ ${ inv . issue . title } _: ${ inv . id . url } /issues/ ${ inv . issue . number } ` , inv . issue . openedBy . person . chatId . screenName ); } } This is registed with a SoftwareDeliveryMachine instance as follows: sdm . addNewIssueListeners ( requestDescription ) Using the credentials on the NewIssueInvocation , you can easily use the GitHub API to modify the issue, for example correcting spelling errors. Repo Creation We frequently want to respond to the creation of a new repository: For example, we may want to notify people, provision infrastructure, or tag it with GitHub topics based on its contents. Listener interfaces There are two scenarios to consider: The creation of a new repository. RepoCreationListener : RepoCreationListener The first push to a repository, which uses the more generic ProjectListener The second scenario is usually more important, as it is possible to create a repository without any source code or a master branch, which isn\u2019t enough to work with for common actions. Example The following example publishes a message to the #general channel in Slack when a new repo has been created: export const PublishNewRepo : SdmListener = ( i : ListenerInvocation ) => { return i . context . messageClient . addressChannels ( `A new repo was created: \\` ${ i . id . owner } : ${ i . id . repo } \\`` , \"general\" ); }; Tagging a repo with topics based on its content is a useful action. tagRepo is a convenient function to construct a ProjectListener for this. It tags as an argument a Tagger , which looks at the project content and returns a Tags object. The following example from atomist.config.ts tags Spring Boot repos, using a Tagger from the spring-automation project, in addition to suggesting the addition of a Cloud Foundry manifest, and publishing the repo using the listener previously shown: sdm . addNewRepoWithCodeActions ( tagRepo ( springBootTagger ), suggestAddingCloudFoundryManifest , PublishNewRepo ) Generators Another important concern is project creation. Consistent project creation is important to governance and provides a way of sharing knowledge across a team. Atomist\u2019s unique take on project generation starts from a seed project \u2013a kind of golden master, that is version controlled using your regular repository hosting solution. A seed project doesn\u2019t need to include template content: It\u2019s a regular project in whatever stack, and Atomist transforms it to be a unique, custom project based on the parameters supplied at the time of project creation. This allows freedom to evolve the seed project with regular development tools. Generators can be registered with an SDM as follows: sdm . addGenerators (() => springBootGenerator ({ ... CommonJavaGeneratorConfig , seedRepo : \"spring-rest-seed\" , intent : \"create spring\" , })) The springBootGenerator function used here is provided in sample-sdm , but it\u2019s easy enough to write your own transformation using the Project API. Here\u2019s most of the code in our real Node generator: export function nodeGenerator ( config : GeneratorConfig , details : Partial < GeneratorCommandDetails < NodeProjectCreationParameters >> = {}) : HandleCommand { return generatorHandler < NodeProjectCreationParameters > ( transformSeed , () => new NodeProjectCreationParameters ( config ), `nodeGenerator- ${ config . seedRepo } ` , { tags : [ \"node\" , \"typescript\" , \"generator\" ], ... details , intent : config.intent , }); } function transformSeed ( params : NodeProjectCreationParameters , ctx : HandlerContext ) { return chainEditors ( updatePackageJsonIdentification ( params . appName , params . target . description , params . version , params . screenName , params . target ), updateReadmeTitle ( params . appName , params . target . description ), ); } You can invoke such a generator from Slack, like this: Note how the repo was automatically tagged with GitHub topics after creation. This was the work of a listener, specified as follows: sdm . addNewRepoWithCodeActions ( tagRepo ( springBootTagger ), ); With Atomist ChatOps supports, you can follow along in a linked channel like this: Note the suggestion to add a Cloud Foundry manifest. This is the work of another listener, which reacts to finding new code in a repo. Listeners and commands such as generators work hand in hand for Atomist. Editors Another core concept is a project editor . An editor is a command that transforms project content. Atomist infrastructure can help persist such transformations through branch commits or pull requests, with clean diffs. A Simple Editor As you\u2019d expect, editors also use th Project API. Here\u2019s an example of a simple editor that takes as a parameter the path of a file to remove from a repository. @Parameters () export class RemoveFileParams { @Parameter () public path : string ; } export const removeFileEditor : HandleCommand = editorCommand < RemoveFileParams > ( () => removeFile , \"remove file\" , RemoveFileParams , { editMode : params => commitToMaster ( `You asked me to remove file ${ params . path } !` ), }); async function removeFile ( p : Project , ctx : HandlerContext , params : RemoveFileParams ) { return p . deleteFile ( params . path ); } Editors can be registered with an SDM as follows: sdm . addEditors ( () => removeFileEditor , ); Dry Run Editors More elaborate editors use helper APIs on top of the Project API such as Atomist\u2019s microgrammar API and ANTLR integration. There\u2019s also an important capability called \u201cdry run editing\u201d: Performing an edit on a branch, and then either raising either a PR or an issue, depending on build success or failure. This allows us to safely apply edits across many repositories. There\u2019s a simple wrapper function to enable this: export const tryToUpgradeSpringBootVersion : HandleCommand = dryRunEditor < UpgradeSpringBootParameters > ( params => setSpringBootVersionEditor ( params . desiredBootVersion ), UpgradeSpringBootParameters , \"boot-upgrade\" , { description : `Upgrade Spring Boot version` , intent : \"try to upgrade Spring Boot\" , }, ); This editor will upgrade the Spring Boot version in one or more projects, then wait to see if the builds succeed. Output will look like this (in the case of success): Tip Dry run editing is another example of how commands and events can work hand in hand with Atomist to provide a uniquely powerful solution. Arbitrary Commands Both generators and editors are special cases of Atomist command handlers , which can be invoked via Slack or HTTP. You can write commands to ensure that anything that needs to be repeated gets done the right way each time, and that the solution isn\u2019t hidden on someone\u2019s machine. Pulling it All Together: The SoftwareDeliveryMachine class Your ideal delivery blueprint spans delivery flow, generators, editors and other commands. All we need is something to pull it together. Your event listeners need to be invoked by Atomist handlers. The SoftwareDeliveryMachine takes care of this, ensuring that the correct handlers are emitted for use in atomist.config.ts , without you needing to worry about the event handler registrations on underlying GraphQL. The SoftwareDeliveryMachine class offers a fluent builder approach to adding command handlers, generators and editors. Example For example: const sdm = createSoftwareDeliveryMachine ( { builder : K8sBuildOnSuccessStatus , deployers : [ K8sStagingDeployOnSuccessStatus , K8sProductionDeployOnSuccessStatus , ], artifactStore , }, whenPushSatisfies ( PushToDefaultBranch , IsMaven , IsSpringBoot , HasK8Spec , PushToPublicRepo ) . setGoals ( HttpServiceGoals ), whenPushSatisfies ( not ( PushFromAtomist ), IsMaven , IsSpringBoot ) . setGoals ( LocalDeploymentGoals ), whenPushSatisfies ( IsMaven , MaterialChangeToJavaRepo ) . setGoals ( LibraryGoals ), whenPushSatisfies ( IsNode ). setGoals ( NpmGoals ), ); sdm . addNewRepoWithCodeActions ( suggestAddingK8sSpec ) . addSupportingCommands (() => addK8sSpec ) . addSupportingEvents (() => NoticeK8sTestDeployCompletion , () => NoticeK8sProdDeployCompletion ) . addEndpointVerificationListeners ( lookFor200OnEndpointRootGet ({ retries : 15 , maxTimeout : 5000 , minTimeout : 3000 , }), ); sdm . addNewIssueListeners ( requestDescription ) . addEditors (() => tryToUpgradeSpringBootVersion ) . addGenerators (() => springBootGenerator ({ seedOwner : \"spring-team\" , seedRepo : \"spring-rest-seed\" , groupId : \"myco\" , })) . addNewRepoWithCodeActions ( tagRepo ( springBootTagger ), suggestAddingCloudFoundryManifest , PublishNewRepo ) . addProjectReviewers ( logReview ) . addPushReactions ( listChangedFiles ) . addFingerprinters ( mavenFingerprinter ) . addDeploymentListeners ( PostToDeploymentsChannel ) . addEndpointVerificationListeners ( LookFor200OnEndpointRootGet ) . addVerifiedDeploymentListeners ( presentPromotionButton ) . addSupersededListeners ( inv => { logger . info ( \"Will undeploy application %j\" , inv . id ); return LocalMavenDeployer . deployer . undeploy ( inv . id ); }) . addSupportingCommands ( () => addCloudFoundryManifest , DescribeStagingAndProd , () => disposeProjectHandler , ) . addSupportingEvents ( OnDryRunBuildComplete ); The SoftwareDeliveryMachine instance will create the necessary Atomist event handlers to export. In atomist.config.ts you can bring them in simply as follows: commands : assembled.commandHandlers , events : assembled.eventHandlers , Plugging in Third Party Tools In addition to the core capabilities of the Atomist platform, an SDM can integrate with third-party tools to execute goals and commands. Integrating CI tools One of the tools you are most likely to integrate is Continuous Integration (CI). For example, you can integrate Jenkins, Travis or Circle CI with Atomist so that these tools are responsible for build. This has potential advantages in terms of scheduling and repeatability of environments. Integrating a CI tool with Atomist is simple. Simply invoke Atomist hooks to send events around build and artifact creation. If integrating CI tools, we recommend the following: CI tools are great for building and generating artifacts. They are often abused as a PaaS for bash . If you find your CI usage has you programming in bash or YML, consider whether invoking such operations from Atomist event handlers might be a better model. Use Atomist generators to create your CI files, and Atomist editors to keep them in synch, minimizing inconsistency. Integrating with Static Analysis Tools Any tool that runs on code, such as Checkstyle, can easily be integrated. If the tool doesn\u2019t have a Node API (which Checkstyle doesn\u2019t as it\u2019s written in Java), you can invoke it via Node spawn , as Node excels at working with child processes. Advanced Push Rules Computed Values You can use computed boolean values or the results of synchronous or asynchronous functions returning boolean in the DSL, making it possible to bring in any state you wish. For example: whenPushSatisfies ( IsMaven , HasSpringBootApplicationClass , deploymentsToday < 25 ) . itMeans ( \"Not tired of deploying Spring apps yet\" ) . setGoals ( LocalDeploymentGoals ), Decision Trees You can write decision trees in push rules or other push mappings. These can be nested to arbitrary depth, and can use computed state. For example: let count = 0 ; const pm : PushMapping < Goals > = given < Goals > ( IsNode ) // Compute a value we'll use later . init (() => count = 0 ) . itMeans ( \"node\" ) . then ( given < Goals > ( IsExpress ). itMeans ( \"express\" ) . compute (() => count ++ ) // Go into tree branch rule set . then ( whenPushSatisfies ( count > 0 ). itMeans ( \"nope\" ). setGoals ( NoGoals ), whenPushSatisfies ( TruePushTest ). itMeans ( \"yes\" ). setGoals ( HttpServiceGoals ), ), );","title":"SDM Concepts"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#core-concepts","text":"An SDM builds on other Atomist core functionality available from global automations, such as Atomist lifecycle messages showing commit, pull request, and other activity through actionable messages in your chat client.","title":"Core Concepts"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#graphql","text":"The Atomist automation API provides you access to the events and data from your development platforms using GraphQL , a widely-used query language and runtime for APIs.

SDMs access the Atomist automation API via a WebSocket connection. WebSockets allow the API server to send events and commands to the SDM without constant polling via HTTP calls. The WebSocket connection is initiated by the SDM when it starts up, establishing a persistent two-way communication channel between the SDM and API that is resilient to interruptions in connectivity.","title":"WebSockets"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#events","text":"The heart of Atomist is its event handling. As your code flows from commit through to deployment and beyond, Atomist receives events, correlates the incoming data with its previous knowledge, and invokes your event handlers with rich context. This enables your automations to perform tasks such as: Scanning code for security or quality issues on every push Driving deployments and promotion between environments Performing custom actions on deployment, such as kicking off integration test suites. The Atomist correlated event model also enables Atomist to provide you with visibility throughout the commit to deployment flow, in Slack or through the Atomist web dashboard. See Events for more information. Event handlers subscribe to events using GraphQL subscriptions against the Atomist cortex. The following GraphQL subscribes to completed builds, returning related data such as the last commit and any linked Slack channels: subscription OnBuildComplete { Build { buildId buildUrl compareUrl name status commit { sha message repo { name owner gitHubId allowRebaseMerge channels { name id } } statuses { context description state targetUrl } } } } When using TypeScript (our recommended language), an event handler can subscribe to such events with the benefit of strong typing. For example, this Atomist event handler can respond to the above GraphQL subscription: @EventHandler ( \"Set status on build complete\" , GraphQL . subscriptionFromFile ( \"graphql/subscription/OnBuildComplete.graphql\" )) export class SetStatusOnBuildComplete implements HandleEvent < OnBuildComplete . Subscription > { public async handle ( event : EventFired < OnBuildComplete . Subscription > , ctx : HandlerContext , params : this ) : Promise < HandlerResult > { This underlying GraphQL/event handler infrastructure is generic and powerful. However, many things are better done at a higher level. This project provides a framework above this infrastructure that makes typical tasks far easier, while not preventing you from breaking out into lower level functionality.","title":"Events"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#sdm-process-lifecycle","text":"The SDM lifecycle will be familiar to those developing persistent applications. Authentication - When the SDM starts up, it connects to the Atomist API and authenticates using the API key you have provided in your configuration file. Registration - Once your identity has been established, the client registers its automations, i.e., the bot commands it provides and the events it wants to receive, with the Atomist workspaces specified in your configuration. If Atomist does not recognize your workspace ID or the provided API key is not connected to any member of that workspace, registration will fail and the SDM will exit with an unsuccessful status. Listening - After authentication and registration is completed successfully, the WebSocket connection is established and the client begins listening for incoming messages from the API: bot commands and events fired. Shutdown - When the client receives a shutdown signal, typically SIGINT delivered by the PaaS or Ctrl-C , it de-registers with the API and gracefully shuts down.","title":"SDM process lifecycle"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#sdm-state","text":"An SDM, once registered, will continue to receive all the events it has subscribed to until shuts down or one of the following scenarios occurs.","title":"SDM state"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#multiple-identical-sdms-register","text":"If another client with the same name and version (typically obtained from the package.json \u201cname\u201d and \u201cversion\u201d properties) registers, then all of the registered identical SDMs will receive the events in a round-robin fashion. Each event will only be sent to one of the identical SDMs. This allows you to horizontally scale.","title":"Multiple identical SDMs register"},{"location":"developer/sdm-concepts/#a-different-version-registers","text":"If another SDM having the same name but different version registers, it will begin receiving all of the events for the client and any previously registered versions cease receiving events. Note that no version comparisons are done: the last registration wins . If the new client has registered with a policy of \u201cephemeral\u201d and the prior client was registered with a policy of \u201cdurable\u201d, then when the new client shuts down, events again be sent to the \u201cdurable\u201d registration clients. The reason for this logic is to allow for production, testing, and local use to all coexist without taking the same action multiple times. For example, if you are running an SDM in production but want to test something, you can run it locally, steal events for a bit, kill the local process, and then traffic will return to the production instance. If you want the same events to be sent to multiple SDMs, just make sure the SDMs have different names. Custom Ingestion Any custom ingestion types can only be registered once within an Atomist workspace.

Atomist also supports running SDMs as Docker containers. This allows you to operate them in Kubernetes clusters or Google Container Engine, for example. This document explains various ways to run SDMs. Running locally The easiest way to run an SDM is to start it up on your local development machine. Running the SDM locally is extremely helpful during development of your automations. You can debug commands and event handlers using local development tools like Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome. You can iterate rapidly because there is no deployment and only a minimal build process. To connect to the Atomist API and respond to events in your team and commands in your team chat, start the SDM by running the following commands: npm run compile && npm start Note The SDM requires an open internet connection to https://automation.atomist.com to successfully register event subscriptions and commands. To receive only your personal commits and commands that you initiate in your terminal, run in local mode: npm run compile && npm start --local Production Production mode Set the environment variable NODE_ENV=production This has two effects: it tells NPM to install only runtime dependencies, not dev-dependencies. it changes the default config in the SDM to [production defaults][prod-default-config-apidoc] run in durable mode. If you want the NPM effect, but not the Atomist configuration change, then set ATOMIST_ENV to \u201ctesting\u201d or \u201cdevelopment\u201d. This will override NODE_ENV for that purpose. [prod-default-config-apidoc: https://atomist.github.io/automation-client/modules/ lib_configuration .html#productiondefaultconfiguration (APIdoc for ProductionDefaultConfig) Node When running in a production environment, you typically want to avoid NPM and run Node.js directly to ensure signals get delivered properly and you can provide guidance to Node.js\u2019s memory management subsystem. Here\u2019s an example startup command for production environments: node $NODE_DEBUG_OPTION --trace-warnings --expose_gc --optimize_for_size \\ --always_compact --max_old_space_size=384 node_modules/.bin/atomist start See node --help and node --v8-options for more detail on these options. Cloud Foundry To push your SDM to an instance of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you need an account on the instance you want to target and you must have the Cloud Foundry CLI installed. For detailed information about the deployment process, consult the Cloud Foundry documentation . A push to Cloud Foundry needs some additional metadata in your project. First you need to create a manifest.yml file in the root of your SDM project: applications : - name : my-sdm command : node node_modules/.bin/atm-start memory : 128M routes : - route : my-sdm.mycompany.net buildpack : https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack env : SUPPRESS_NO_CONFIG_WARNING : true NODE_ENV : production Note Technically a manifest.yml is not required but it makes things simpler. Next add an \"engines\" top-level entry to your package.json file: \"engines\" : { \"node\" : \"8.x.x\" , \"npm\" : \"5.x.x\" } Finally, start the deployment with: cf push Docker Shipping your SDM as a Docker image allows you to package up all required tools and dependencies. This is especially useful if you plan on reusing existing scripts or command line tools in your automations. To set up a Docker image build, you need a Dockerfile . Read the documentation on building Docker images for more details. Your SDM probably already has a Dockerfile in it, from the Dockerfile in the seed . If not, copy that one in. You should also have .dockerignore . Running in Docker locally In Docker, the SDM will only run in team mode. Local mode does not work yet. Vote here if you want it. With the Dockerfile in place, you can now start the Docker build. Change the name and version of the tag in this command: npm run build && \\ docker build . -t your-sdm:0.1.0 Start by running the Docker container locally. This command lets it use the configuration set up when you ran atomist config : docker run --rm --mount source=$HOME/.atomist,target=/root/.atomist,type=bind your-sdm Deploying with Docker The Dockerfile supplied in the seeds runs the SDM in development mode. Change ATOMIST_ENV to [production][#production-mode] and rebuild the container for production deployment, so that when your SDM goes down or restarts, events will be queued. Deploying to Kubernetes If you deploy to kubernetes, you\u2019ll need kubectl installed. Add this to your Dockerfile: RUN curl -sL -o /usr/local/bin/kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.12/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl \\ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl \\ && kubectl version --client You may prefer a later release of kubectl.

See architecture for a high-level view. Your SDM is in TypeScript. Start with our code and add what you choose.

To get started in local mode , make sure you have: Git Node.js the Atomist CLI Before you run in team mode , you\u2019ll need the prerequisites page. This page will help you: create an SDM project spin up your SDM know where to add functionality to your SDM For the quickest path to seeing an SDM do something, use the Quick Start instead. Creating an SDM project The Atomist CLI will generate a starter SDM for you. atomist create sdm For \u201cType of SDM to create, \u201cChoose \u201cblank\u201d to start with an empty SDM, or \u201cspring\u201d to start with an SDM that does useful things for Java Spring services. For \u201cname of the target repository\u201d enter a name for your SDM. For \u201ctarget-owner\u201d enter a name for the owner of your project. This corresponds to the GitHub/GitLab organization or BitBucket project you would put the repository under. The \u201ccreate sdm\u201d generator will transform the seed according to your answers. Because this generator operates in local mode, it will create a project on your filesystem. Look in $HOME/atomist/ target-owner / name for the new SDM. GitHub If you prefer the manual route, you can always fork the empty-sdm project on GitHub. Looking at the code You can use whatever editor or IDE you like. We recommend VSCode because it is built for TypeScript (among other languages), it\u2019s a good IDE, and it\u2019s free. With TypeScript and an IDE like VSCode, you get autocompletion that helps you discover functionality in the SDM framework. Run npm install first so that your IDE will see library code. In Node, all dependencies are stored within the project, under the directory node_modules . npm is the dependency manager that gets them there. The node_modules directory is listed in .gitignore , so it won\u2019t be committed. index.ts Start your inquiry in index.ts . When an SDM starts up, it looks here to find its configuration. The configuration object has opportunities for many, many configuration options. Click into the Configuration type or check the API Docs if you\u2019re curious. The important part, where you\u2019re going to add to your personal SDM, is the function passed to configureSdm in configuration.postProcessors . Unless you change it, that function is called machine . machine.ts Click into the machine function in your IDE, or open lib/machine/machine.ts to find it. This function instantiates and the returns a SoftwareDeliveryMachine( API docs ). Inside this function, add functionality to your SDM. You can: Add Goals to choose a flow to respond to code push Add listeners to various other events Bring in extension packs Building an SDM SDM projects are written in TypeScript and run on Node.js . Building an SDM is the same as any standard TypeScript or JavaScript project. First you install the project\u2019s dependencies: npm install then build the project, linting the TypeScript, compiling the TypeScript into JavaScript, generating other required files, and running tests: npm run build Starting an SDM There are a few different ways to start the SDM, depending on how you are running it. If you are running the SDM locally, you can use the standard NPM start command. npm start If you are writing your own SDMs, you probably want a more responsive testing environment, having the client restart any time you make changes to the source code. This development flow is available with the autostart command. npm run autostart When you deploy your SDM to production, check the recommendations under Deploying your SDM .

Messages can be sent by an event handler or a command handler. Rich messages take full advantage of Slack\u2019s native message formatting capabilities Actionable messages contain buttons and menus that trigger new commands on behalf of the user who clicked them Updatable messages can be rewritten with new content over time in response to new events and actions. This helps reduce the number of messages from the Atomist bot in a Slack channel. Here\u2019s an example of a message with different Attachments and Actions from the Atomist open source community Slack workspace. If you\u2019re not familiar with the main concepts of Slack message formatting, you may want to read Slack\u2019s documentation before you read the following sections. MessageClient interface Let\u2019s take a look at the MessageClient interface. export interface MessageClient { respond ( msg : string | SlackMessage , options? : MessageOptions ) : Promise < any > ; addressUsers ( msg : string | SlackMessage , userNames : string | string [], options? : MessageOptions ) : Promise < any > ; addressChannels ( msg : string | SlackMessage , channelNames : string | string [], options? : MessageOptions ) : Promise < any > ; ... } The MessageClient provides access to methods for sending messages to Slack. It allows you to address messages to users or channels by name or to simply send a response message. Generally the MessageClient is available from the HandlerContext parameter to the handle method of command and event handlers. Response messages A response message is a message that is sent while handling a request to run a certain command; they can therefore only be sent by command handlers. Use the respond method to sending a response message. The Atomist platform takes care of delivering the message into the right conversation in Slack. The following example shows how to send a response message from a command handler. export class HelloWorld implements HandleCommand { public handle ( ctx : HandlerContext ) : Promise < HandlerResult > { return ctx . messageClient . respond ( \"Hello from Atomist\" ) . then (() => Success , failure ); } } User and channel messages Address messages to users by calling the addressUsers method, providing one or more names of Slack users. To send a message to one or more channels, call the addressChannels method. Note If you want to send a direct message to a user in your Slack workspace, use the addressUsers method with the user name of the recipient. Here is an example of sending a simple message into the #general channel of your Slack workspace: export class HelloWorld implements HandleCommand { public handle ( ctx : HandlerContext ) : Promise < HandlerResult > { return ctx . messageClient . addressChannels ( \"Hello from Atomist\" , \"general\" ) . then (() => Success , failure ); } } In this example, you are sending the message only to the #general channel. It is possible to send the same message into more than one channel by simply providing an array of channel names to the addressChannels method. The same works for addressUsers . Formatting messages In the previous section you saw how to address and send messages to Slack. This section covers formatting simple and complex Slack messages. It also demonstrates how to add buttons and menus to messages. Simple messages The addressUsers , addressChannels and respond methods accept a string message as first argument. A simple string message can still have some basic formatting. Here are a couple of examples of simple messages: Code Output messageClient.respond(\"This is a plain message\"); This is a plan message messageClient.respond(\"This some *bold* text\"); This is some bold text messageClient.respond(\"This some _italics_ text\"); This is some italics text messageClient.respond(\"Some multiline\\ntext\"); Some multiline text More details on Slack text formatting can be found their the documentation . Rich messages For more complex, rich messages, Atomist provides the SlackMessage type as part of the @atomist/slack-messages NPM module. The SlackMessage type can have Attachments and Actions . More details on those concepts can be found in the Slack documentation . In order to create a formatted Slack message, simply build an instance of SlackMessage with all desired properties. Here is an example: import * as slack from \"@atomist/slack-messages\" ; const message : slack.SlackMessage = { attachments : [{ fallback : \"How to filter by parent or ancestor directory with sysdig\" , author_name : \"Janek Bogucki\" , author_link : \"https://stackoverflow.com/users/148440/janek-bogucki\" , author_icon : \"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ccd05d83049593205406ac74eacb323?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG\" , title : \"How to filter by parent or ancestor directory withsysdig\" , title_link : \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41827350/how-to-filter-by-parent-or-ancestor-directory-with-sysdig\" , thumb_url : \"https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=wi75.he75&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sstatic.net%2FSites%2Fstackoverflow%2Fimg%2Fapple-touch-icon%402.png%3Fv%3D73d79a89bded\" , footer : \"file, sysdig\" , ts : 1485258115 }, { fallback : \"Show more...\" , title : \"Show more...\" , title_link : \"http://stackoverflow.com/search?order=desc&sort=relevance&q=atomist\" }] }; Once the SlackMessage is created you can send it via the MessageClient : ctx . messageClient . respond ( message ); This renders the following in Slack: Adding message buttons In the previous section you saw how rich messages can be created and posted to Slack. Now you\u2019ll see how to turn this message into an actionable message by adding a button to it. With Atomist, it\u2019s easy to bind Slack action buttons to command handlers. Such a binding consists of three parts: the specification of the button as required by Slack, a reference to the command handler , and optional parameters that should be pre-populated when invoking the command. The button specification is defined by Slack in the field guide . Here is an example of a button with a confirmation pop-up: import { ButtonSpecification } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const buttonSpec : ButtonSpecification = { text : \"Search Again\" , confirm : { title : \"Search Again?\" , text : \"Do you really want to run the search again?\" , dismiss_text : \"No\" , ok_text : \"Yes\" }, }; buttonForCommand Section content not yet populated Sorry, we haven\u2019t written this part of the documentation yet. Will you tell us what questions are important to you? We\u2019re happy to help in the #support channel in Atomist community Slack . You can also contribute to this guide with an issue or pull request on the docs repository . Adding message menus Message menus are very similar to message buttons in the way they are created and added to the message. The main difference is that menus are defined with a MenuSpecification instead of a ButtonSpecification . Besides the name of the menu, a MenuSpecification allows you to define menu options and option groups. See the following example: import { MenuSpecification } from \"@atomist/sdm\" ; const menuSpec : MenuSpecification = { text : \"Issue Labels\" , options : [{ text : \"Bug\" , value : \"bug\" , }, { text : \"Enhancement\" , value : \"enhancement\" , }, { text : \"Invalid\" , value : \"invalid\" , }], }; const message : slack.SlackMessage = { attachments : [{ // ... actions : [ menuForCommand ( menuSpec , handler , \"label\" ), ], }], }; To create the menu, menuForCommand is called with the menu details, the reference to the command handler and the name of the parameter on the command handler that the selected value of the menu should be bound to; in this example, the value of the option will be bound to the label parameter. Message options With MessageOptions actionable Slack message can be turned into updatable messages; the MessageOptions interface provides important options to handle and tune message updates and rewrites in Slack. The following section describes the properties on the MessageOptions interface and what they can be used for. See also: [APIDoc][message-options-apidoc] For example: const messageOptions = { id: `build-summary/${owner}/${repo}/${sha}`, // sending another message with this ID will update this one ts: Date.now(), ttl: 60 * 60 * 1000, // update this message for up to one hour; after that, post anew post: \"always\", // if this message didn't exist, create it } The id property uniquely identifies a message in a channel or direct message. But it\u2019s optional! Use it if you want to update this message later. Otherwise we\u2019ll generate something unique. ts specifies the time in milliseconds of the message. If not set, it defaults to the current time. This property is important to maintain correct order of messages: the Atomist bot will not post a message with a ts if there is a message for the same id but a later ts already in the channel or direct message. ttl or time-to-live defines the amount of time in milliseconds that a message can be updated, after which a new instance of the message is posted to the bottom of the Slack stream. So, when a message is received by the bot, it compares the ts + ttl of the existing message with ts of the new message; if ts + ttl is smaller, a new message ia posted to the bottom of the Slack stream and the existing message is not rewritten. As long ts + ttl is greater then ts of the new message, the existing message will be overwritten. Lastly, the post property specifies whether a message should be posted only if it is an update to a previously posted message with the same id . If post === \"always\" , the message is always posted as a new message and never rewrites a previous message. will never rewrite a previous message.

When we know exactly how we want to change the code, we can automate that. Compared to doing it by hand, automation is consistent and repeatable. Atomist gives us the superpower to change code on demand, in one project or hundreds, and in response to events. These changes become commits, branches, or pull requests. Begin with a Code Transform: a function that acts on a project. You write this part, and test it with unit tests. Turn that into a command to run on demand, then an Autofix to run on every push. This page shows how to: Create a code transform that runs on-demand Require parameters to your code transform Customize the automated pull request Make Atomist wait for a build to succeed before creating the pull request Make Atomist merge the PR automatically when a build succeeds After that, you might want to make your code transform into an Autofix . Create a code transform Code transforms are functions that receive the project as an input and changes the content of the project as a result. Assume we want to add an Apache licence file to the project. The transform would retrieve the license content and add a LICENSE file with that content. export const AddApacheLicenseFileTransform : CodeTransform < NoParameters > = async ( p : Project ) => { const httpClient = DefaultHttpClientFactory . create (); const license = await httpClient . exchange ( \"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt\" ); return p . addFile ( \"LICENSE\" , license . body as string ); }; See also: the Project interface (the API for modifying files in the project) HTTP calls in an SDM (if you\u2019re curious why that example uses DefaultHttpClientFactory) Creating a command for a transform A code transform can be called through various means. One of those means is directly through issuing a command. This command needs to be defined and the transform needs to be referenced in that definition. export const AddApacheLicenseFile : CodeTransformRegistration < NoParameters > = { transform : AddApacheLicenseFileTransform , name : \"add apache license file\" , description : `Add Apache 2.0 license file` , intent : [ \"add apache license file\" , \"add license file\" ], }; Each intent acts as an alias for invoking the command. The description is going to be the title of an automatic pull request. The transform\u2019s name will appear in the branch. See also: CodeTransformRegistration API doc Adding the transform command to the SDM Tell the SDM about the command. In order to achieve this you need to register the command with the SDM. In your SDM definition where you have access to the SDM instance, add the following registration: sdm . addCodeTransformCommand ( AddApacheLicenseFile ); See also: Adding functionality to your SDM Calling the command Local To test your command, run your SDM in local mode and then atomist start --local then, in a separate terminal, change directory to one of your repositories under your Atomist project root (usually $HOME/atomist). Then: atomist add apache license file Atomist will create a new branch with the changed code on it. List all your branches to find it: git branch Team When you run your SDM in team mode , your command will be available in chat. Go to a channel associated with a repository , and talk to the Atomist bot: @atomist add apache license file Atomist will create a branch and apply the code transform on that branch. It will also create a pull request for the commits generated by that branch. By default, the name of the pull request will be the description of the code transform.

You can still issue the values for non-required parameters like this: @atomist add apache license file license=gpl Changing the branch and generated pull request If you want, you can alter the contents of the pull request by defining a transformPresentation on the code transform. export const AddApacheLicenseFile: CodeTransformRegistration<AddApacheLicenseFileParameters> = { transform: AddApacheLicenseFileTransform, paramsMaker: AddApacheLicenseFileParameters, name: \"add apache license file\", description: `Add Apache 2.0 license file`, intent: [\"add apache license file\", \"add license file\"], transformPresentation: () => new editModes.PullRequest(\"license-file\", \"Add license file\"), }; This will cause the transform to be run on the license-file branch and the resulting pull request have Add license file as a title. Defer pull request creation based on build outcome Atomist will automatically create a pull request when executing a code transform. However, the goal set execution can still fail. To mitigate unneeded unstable pull request creation, you can wrap your code transform registration in the makeBuildAware function. export const AddApacheLicenseFile : CodeTransformRegistration < AddApacheLicenseFileParameters > = makeBuildAware ({ transform : AddApacheLicenseFileTransform , paramsMaker : AddApacheLicenseFileParameters , name : \"add apache license file\" , description : `Add Apache 2.0 license file` , intent : [ \"add apache license file\" , \"add license file\" ], }); Enabling auto merge of pull request based on build outcome By default, you still need to manually merge the pull request. You can however configure code transforms to auto merge on a successful goalset execution. You can achieve this by pressing the Enable Auto Merge button that is shown in Slack in the pull request message. This will add a certain label ( auto-merge:on-check-success ) to the pull request, which indicates to Atomist that the pull request needs to be merged on a succesful goalset execution.

Once deployed, Atomist provides feedback on the health of running applications and uses standard Kubernetes mechanism for zero-downtime deployments. Overview Before getting started, it is helpful to provide some information about how Atomist interacts with Kubernetes. Atomist is able to deploy and update applications to Kubernetes as well as report back on the health of those applications, providing feedback in the Atomist dashboard or Slack on deployments running containers across clusters and namespaces in the concise, correlated manner users of Atomist expect. Deploying and updating applications The Atomist k8-automation utility manages deploying and updating applications. It is able to create deployments to manage the runtime of the application container, services to provide standard Kubernetes discovery capabilities, and ingresses to provide the properly hosted and secured external access to services. The k8-automation utility runs inside each Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy applications to, using a Kubernetes service account with only the permissions needed to create, read, update, and delete namespaces, deployments, services, and ingresses. Container status The Atomist k8vent utility watches pods in your Kubernetes cluster and sends change events, e.g., container started and container crashed, back to Atomist. Like k8-automation, the k8vent utility runs inside each Kubernetes cluster you want events from, using a Kubernetes service account with only the permissions needed to watch pod events. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) To perform their tasks, the Atomist utilities running within a Kubernetes cluster need access to do so. In modern, i.e., version 1.6 or greater, Kubernetes clusters, this access is provided using role-based access control (RBAC) . Briefly, a service account is created and bound to roles with the appropriate privileges. The pod is then configured to use the service account when accessing the Kubernetes API using the in-cluster client. Part of deploying the Atomist utilities to your Kubernetes cluster is creating the needed RBAC resources. To create RBAC resources, your Kubernetes user needs admin privileges. If your Kubernetes user does not have admin privileges in the cluster or a namespace, someone whose Kuberetes user has those privileges will need to deploy the Atomist utilities. If you see errors like the following when you try to deploy the Atomist utilities to your Kubernetes cluster, Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"rbac.yaml\": clusterroles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io \"k8-automation-clusterrole\" is forbidden: attempt to grant extra privileges: [...] user=&{YOUR_USER [system:authenticated] map[]} ownerrules=[PolicyRule{Resources:[\"selfsubjectaccessreviews\"], APIGroups:[\"authorization.k8s.io\"], Verbs:[\"create\"]} PolicyRule{NonResourceURLs:[\"/api\" \"/api/*\" \"/apis\" \"/apis/*\" \"/healthz\" \"/swagger-2.0.0.pb-v1\" \"/swagger.json\" \"/swaggerapi\" \"/swaggerapi/*\" \"/version\"], Verbs:[\"get\"]}] ruleResolutionErrors=[] then your Kubernetes user does not have administrative privileges on your cluster/namespace. You will either need to ask someone who has admin privileges on the cluster/namespace to create the RBAC resources or try to escalate your privileges in the cluster/namespace. In the following commands, replace USER with your Kubernetes user name. To attempt to provide your Kubernetes user with cluster admin privileges, run: kubectl create clusterrolebinding USER-cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=USER To attempt to provide your Kubernetes user with namespace admin privileges, run: kubectl create --namespace=NAMESPACE rolebinding USER-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole=admin --user=USER Then run the command to deploy the Atomist utilities again. GKE and RBAC By default, the user you authenticate with a GKE cluster does not have sufficient permissions to install the Atomist Kubernetes utilities. To grant your user the necessary permissions, run the cluster-wide command above replacing USER in the commands above with $(gcloud config get-value account) : kubectl create clusterrolebinding \\ $(gcloud config get-value account)-cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value account) If you see errors like the following when you try to deploy the Atomist utilities to your Kubernetes cluster, unable to decode \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomist/k8vent/master/kube/kubectl/cluster-wide.yaml\": no kind \"ClusterRole\" is registered for version \"rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1\" unable to decode \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomist/k8vent/master/kube/kubectl/cluster-wide.yaml\": no kind \"ClusterRoleBinding\" is registered for version \"rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1\" then either your kubectl CLI, Kubernetes cluster, or both are too old and do not support RBAC. Upgrade your kubectl CLI and Kubernetes cluster or contact us for help in deploying the Atomist utilities. Cluster vs. namespace The Atomist utilities can run in two modes: cluster wide and namespace scoped. If your Kubernetes user has cluster-admin role access, which is typically the case if you created the cluster, you can and probably should deploy Atomist utilities in cluster-wide mode. This allows these utilities to manage and report on applications across all namespaces in your cluster. If you are limited to managing Kubernetes resources in a single namespace and your user has admin role access to that namespace, you should probably install in namespace-scoped mode. If your Kubernetes user has neither cluster-admin or admin role access, you will need to ask someone who does to install the Atomist utilities in your cluster. If you want the Atomist Kubernetes utilities to report on and manage resources in several but not all namespaces, you can deploy the Atomist utilities using namespace-scoped mode multiple times, one time for each namespace you want reported on and managed. Cluster environment The Atomist Kubernetes utilities use the concept of a cluster environment . While the cluster environment is an arbitrary description of the Kubernetes cluster to which you are deploying the Atomist Kubernetes utilities, it is used to link application deployment requests and cluster activity to the other activity in your development flow. Therefore it should be meaningful to you and your team and unique across your organization\u2019s Kubernetes clusters. Examples of good cluster environments are \u201cproduction\u201d, \u201cend-user\u201d, \u201cuat\u201d, \u201cstaging\u201d, etc. The cluster environment you provide when installing the Atomist Kubernetes utilities will be used when reporting on Kubernetes pod container activity in development lifecycle messages. For example, the following image shows the containers that are running a specific Docker image from a specific commit and build in various namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster environment \u201cgke-int-demo\u201d. The cluster environment is used by k8-automation and your software delivery machine (SDM) to coordinate application deployments and upgrades. Since you may be deploying k8-automation to multiple Kubernetes clusters, the cluster environment is used as part of the application deployment/update request to select the Kubernetes cluster. Prerequisites Before you connect Atomist and your Kubernetes cluster(s), you need a few prerequisites. Atomist workspace You must have an Atomist workspace. If you do not already have one, you can create one following the instructions in the getting started documentation . Kubernetes cluster You must have a Kubernetes cluster and access to that cluster as a user with either cluster-admin role privileges to run in cluster-wide mode or admin role privileges within a namespace to run in namespace-scoped mode. If you do not have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can create one on your local system using minikube . Installation Several different methods for installing the Atomist Kubernetes utilities are supported. Choose the one that makes sense for your situation. If you aren\u2019t sure how to proceed, try the Atomist CLI approach as it is the easiest. Atomist CLI To use the Atomist CLI to install the Atomist Kubernetes utilities, you must have the Atomist CLI installed and configured . You will also need the Kubernetes kubectl command-line utility installed and configured to access your Kubernetes cluster with the needed privileges. Once you have the Atomist and Kubernetes CLIs installed and configured, you can install the Atomist Kubernetes utilities one the following commands. Be sure to replace CLUSTER_ENV with a meaningful name for you Kubernetes cluster/namespace and, if deploying in namespace-scoped mode, NAMESPACE with the existing namespace you want to deploy the utilities to. Cluster-wide mode To install the Atomist Kubernetes utilities in cluster-wide mode, able to report on and manage resources in all namespaces, run the following command. atomist kube --environment=\"CLUSTER_ENV\" Namespace-scoped mode To install the Atomist Kubernetes utilities in namespace-scoped mode, run the following command for each namespace you want to deploy them to. Replace NAMESPACE with the namespace you want to deploy the utilities to. atomist kube --namespace=\"NAMESPACE\" --environment=\"CLUSTER_ENV\" Kubernetes CLI If you have the kubectl command-line utility installed and configured to access your Kubernetes cluster with the needed privileges, you can install the needed Atomist utilities with the proper configuration using the following commands. Be sure to replace CLUSTER_ENV with a meaningful name for you Kubernetes cluster/namespace, WORKSPACE_ID with your Atomist workspace ID, and API_KEY with a valid Atomist API key. See the developer prerequisites for more information on Atomist workspace IDs and API keys. Cluster-wide mode k8vent To deploy k8vent in cluster-wide mode and have it report on changes to all pod containers, run the following command. kubectl apply --filename=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomist/k8vent/master/kube/kubectl/cluster-wide.yaml kubectl create secret --namespace=k8vent generic k8vent --from-literal=environment=\"CLUSTER_ENV\" \\ --from-literal=webhooks=\"https://webhook.atomist.com/atomist/kube/teams/WORKSPACE_ID\" k8-automation To deploy k8-automation in cluster-wide mode with the ability to manage applications in all namespaces, run the following command. kubectl apply --filename=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomist/k8-automation/master/assets/kubectl/cluster-wide.yaml kubectl create secret --namespace=k8-automation generic automation \\ --from-literal=config=\"{\\\"workspaceIds\\\":[\\\"WORKSPACE_ID\\\"],\\\"apiKey\\\":\\\"API_KEY\\\",\\\"environment\\\":\\\"CLUSTER_ENV\\\"}\" Namespace-scoped mode In the commands below, replace NAMESPACE with the namespace you want to deploy the utilities to. k8vent To deploy k8vent in namespace-scoped mode such that it will only report on pod containers in a single namespace, run the following commands. kubectl create secret --namespace=\"NAMESPACE\" generic k8vent \\ --from-literal=environment=\"CLUSTER_ENV\" \\ --from-literal=webhooks=\"https://webhook.atomist.com/atomist/kube/teams/WORKSPACE_ID\" kubectl apply --namespace=\"NAMESPACE\" \\ --filename=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomist/k8vent/master/kube/kubectl/namespace-scoped.yaml k8-automation To deploy k8-automation in namespace-scoped mode such that it will only deploy and update resources in a single Kubernetes cluster namespace, run the following commands. kubectl create secret --namespace=\"NAMESPACE\" generic automation \\ --from-literal=config=\"{\\\"workspaceIds\\\":[\\\"WORKSPACE_ID\\\"],\\\"apiKey\\\":\\\"API_KEY\\\",\\\"environment\\\":\\\"CLUSTER_ENV\\\",\\\"kubernetes\\\":{\\\"mode\\\":\\\"namespace\\\"}}\" kubectl apply --namespace=\"NAMESPACE\" \\ --filename=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomist/k8-automation/master/assets/kubectl/namespace-scoped.yaml Helm If you manage resources in your Kubernetes cluster with Helm , you can install the Atomist Kubernetes utilities using Helm. Replace API_KEY with an Atomist API key, WORKSPACE_ID with your Atomist workspace ID, and CLUSTER_ENV with a meaningful name for your Kubernetes cluster/namespace. Helm and Minikube Due to a bug in the default minikube bootstrapper localkube, kubernetes/helm#3135: Helm 2.7.0 creates RBAC resource fail , if you want to manage RBAC resources using Helm in minikube, you must start minikube using the kubeadm bootstrapper. minikube start --bootstrapper kubeadm You can make kubeadm your default bootstrapper by running the following command. minikube config set bootstrapper kubeadm Cluster-wide mode To install all of the Atomist Kubernetes utilities in cluster-wide mode, run the following helm command. helm upgrade --install --namespace=atomist atomist-utilities \\ --repo=https://atomist.github.io/helm-charts atomist-utilities \\ --set=global.atomist.apiKey=\"API_KEY\" \\ --set=global.atomist.workspaceIds=\"{WORKSPACE_ID}\" \\ --set=global.atomist.environment=\"CLUSTER_ENV\" Namespace-scoped mode To install all of the Atomist Kubernetes utilities in namespace-scoped mode, run the following helm command for each namespace you want to deploy them to. Replace NAMESPACE with the namespace you want to deploy the utilities to. helm upgrade --install --namespace=\"NAMESPACE\" \"atomist-utilities-NAMESPACE\" \\ --repo=https://atomist.github.io/helm-charts atomist-utilities \\ --set=global.atomist.apiKey=\"API_KEY\" \\ --set=global.atomist.workspaceIds=\"{WORKSPACE_ID}\" \\ --set=global.atomist.environment=\"CLUSTER_ENV\" \\ --set=global.atomist.mode=namespace Updating You can update to a new version of the Atomist Kubernetes utilities using standard Kubernetes approaches. If you installed the Atomist utilities using the Atomist CLI or Helm, simply re-run the same command you ran to install them. If you are using kubectl you can run the following commands, replacing NAMESPACE and M.N.P as appropriate. kubectl set image --namespace=NAMESPACE \\ deployment/k8vent k8vent=atomist/k8vent:M.N.P kubectl set image --namespace=NAMESPACE \\ deployment/k8-automation k8-automation=atomist/k8-automation:M.N.P You can always find the latest versions of k8-automation and k8vent on their release pages.","title":"Kubernetes"},{"location":"pack/kubernetes/#overview","text":"Before getting started, it is helpful to provide some information about how Atomist interacts with Kubernetes.

If your Kubernetes user has cluster-admin role access, which is typically the case if you created the cluster, you can and probably should deploy Atomist utilities in cluster-wide mode. This allows these utilities to manage and report on applications across all namespaces in your cluster. If you are limited to managing Kubernetes resources in a single namespace and your user has admin role access to that namespace, you should probably install in namespace-scoped mode. If your Kubernetes user has neither cluster-admin or admin role access, you will need to ask someone who does to install the Atomist utilities in your cluster. If you want the Atomist Kubernetes utilities to report on and manage resources in several but not all namespaces, you can deploy the Atomist utilities using namespace-scoped mode multiple times, one time for each namespace you want reported on and managed.","title":"Cluster vs. namespace"},{"location":"pack/kubernetes/#cluster-environment","text":"The Atomist Kubernetes utilities use the concept of a cluster environment .

Therefore it should be meaningful to you and your team and unique across your organization\u2019s Kubernetes clusters. Examples of good cluster environments are \u201cproduction\u201d, \u201cend-user\u201d, \u201cuat\u201d, \u201cstaging\u201d, etc. The cluster environment you provide when installing the Atomist Kubernetes utilities will be used when reporting on Kubernetes pod container activity in development lifecycle messages. For example, the following image shows the containers that are running a specific Docker image from a specific commit and build in various namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster environment \u201cgke-int-demo\u201d. The cluster environment is used by k8-automation and your software delivery machine (SDM) to coordinate application deployments and upgrades.

Atomist is here to help you smooth your development flow. Start with our web console; see consolidated event notifications. Add ChatOps with Slack if you have it. Spawn your own software delivery machine, and integrate with other tools as you choose. When you enroll in the Atomist service, you get built-in automations such as Lifecycle Messages (Slack notifications on code push, PR, issue etc with action buttons) and commands like \u201ccreate issue\u201d. And your own Software Delivery Machines will work on events and commands from your whole organization. You can also use a Software Delivery Machine (SDM) on your laptop, individually, without enrolling in the service. To get going with a Local SDM, skip to the quick start guide . This page describes how to create an Atomist workspace . An Atomist workspace connects your code, build, deployment, and runtime platforms into a single, cohesive model of how your team provides value: delivering great solutions. Prerequisites You must have a Git source code management account, either GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise (GHE), or BitBucket. If you want to use Atomist with GHE or BitBucket, please contact Atomist . The remainder of these instructions assume you have a GitHub.com account. If you do not already have a GitHub.com account, you can create one . For the whole shebang, it helps to have a GitHub organization and a Slack workspace. You can create these for free and have full admin powers, if you want to experiment. Hello Atomist Follow the instructions in the sign up or trial invitation email you received. When you first sign up, you\u2019ll be asked to authenticate with GitHub. Once you\u2019ve authenticated, you\u2019ll create a new Atomist workspace. Associate a GitHub organization with the Atomist workspace to start getting events. Atomist will ask your permission to create the needed webhook(s). For more information on how Atomist integrates with GitHub, see the GitHub integration documentation. The Atomist web dashboard will show you events, e.g., new commits and issue and pull request activity, from GitHub. Next steps Now that you have an Atomist workspace, you can Connect Atomist with your Slack workspace Connect Atomist with your continuous integration solution Connect Atomist with your Kubernetes clusters Configure the built-in chat integration You can also customize Atomist, molding it to your team\u2019s delivery model.

This visibility is enabled via webhooks. Atomist allows you to take action in your repositories, creating issues, merging pull requests, even releasing services to production, from the Atomist dashboard or in chat. To release the full ChatOps power of Atomist, each user on your team will independently authorize Atomist \u2013 this means that your users remain within the boundaries of the existing GitHub security model. Atomist acts on behalf of your users, not instead of them. Webhooks Atomist receives its information from GitHub via webhooks . To ease adoption across your organization, installing an organization webhook is recommended. To try Atomist out on a small scale, you can install webhooks repository by repository. Organization webhooks GitHub organization members that have the owner role , are allowed to configure organization webhooks. This is convenient because it only has to be configured once; however, you will require a user who has the Owner role in your GitHub organization. you> @atomist enroll org When you choose to enroll a GitHub organization, you will most likely be prompted to authorize a new scope (Atomist only asks for new scopes when explicitly required). The admin:org_hook is required when enrolling a new GitHub organization. If you are a member of more than one GitHub organization, Atomist asks you to choose which organization to enroll. Repository webhooks If your team does not use a GitHub organization account, you can choose to configure webhooks on individual repositories owned by your user account. GitHub user authorization When the Atomist bot first arrives in a Slack workspace, it will send a direct message to the authorizing user, requesting that they authorize Atomist to access GitHub on their behalf. This same dialog will be shown to users anytime Atomist detects that an automation needs to access GitHub as that user. Every member of the workspace must individually opt in. Atomist will display this option each time an un-authorized user runs a command that requires a GitHub authorization.

Atomist uses the native integration technology for each platform or tool. For example, to integrate with GitHub and Travis CI, Atomist uses webhooks; to integrate with Slack it uses their event API. For each platform Atomist integrates with, it requests the minimal set of permissions required. If you use a system or tool Atomist does not natively support, you can implement your own integrations. You can use whatever tools and libraries you want to communicate with your systems, and then register these custom event types with Atomist so it can properly connect them with other events. Chat Integrations Send messages to channels and people, receive commands, query people for command parameters, update messages, and include buttons on messages.

Members can \\invite the Atomist bot to channels to access the full functionality of Atomist. Bot users cannot create channels, cannot join channels unless they are invited by a non-bot channel member, and cannot see messages in channels where they are not a member.
